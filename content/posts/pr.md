OFFICIAL PRESS RELEASE
Issued by Edgar Hoover, Representative of State Directorate of Order and Security

FOR IMMEDIATE DISSEMINATION

THE END OF THE SYNDICATE: A CALL TO ELIMINATE THE FINAL THREAT

Loyal citizens of Zetovia, today I bring you the truth—unfiltered and undeniable. The Syndicate, that treacherous band of traitors, lies in ruins. Most of its members have been wiped out, their misguided rebellion crushed beneath the unwavering might of our great state. But our work is not yet finished. A grave threat still lingers in the shadows, plotting against our homeland. Finally Benjamin was eliminated, who took the life of Gregor, and he didn't even leave the diplomat from Nordigrad,but along the way our nation lost great treasures, as this filth took away another life, as I disposed it off.

For years, I have dedicated my service to ensuring the absolute security of our nation. I have personally overseen the rise and controlled destruction of many such radical groups—each designed to attract dissenters, only to expose and eliminate them before they could ever strike. This strategy has preserved the sanctity of Zetovia, safeguarding our people from the cancer of treason. But this time, we faced an anomaly.

Albert Balsalm—once a mere cog in this mechanism—slipped beyond our control. His reckless actions have resulted in the murders of key individuals, disrupting the very balance we so carefully maintained. And now,  Charlie Stockholm, who was cunning enough to see through the system, remains at large, still working against the foundations of our glorious state. This proves, beyond doubt, that he is not just another radical he is an imminent danger to the survival of Zetovia itself.

That is why I call upon you, the finest defenders of order, to assist in the final purge. We must root out Charlie Stockholm and erase every remnant of this treasonous plague. This is not just justice; this is vengeance for those who have fallen. This is the final step to securing an eternal peace for our people.

Let no man stand against Zetovia. Let no enemy slip through our grasp.

LONG LIVE ZETOVIA!
