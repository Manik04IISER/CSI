# Unfinished Personal Notes – Elias Stokes
- Date: Unknown (Estimated Late 1984 – Early 1985)
- Recovered From: Abandoned Safehouse, Pre-Party Era District

I don’t know if this will ever be read. I don’t know if I will be alive long enough to care. But I refuse to let my thoughts be buried in silence.
The Party was not born from a desire for strength. It was born from a fear of weakness. A fear that truth, if left unchecked, would reveal too much.
I see it clearly now:

Albert saw the lies in the numbers.

Dianne saw the lies in the words.

I saw the lies in the foundation itself.

We are all hunted because we could prove that the Party’s authority is built on contradictions. That it is not a force of unity, but of erasure.
If I am found, if this is my last entry—know this:
History is a controlled variable.
Loyalty is measured by obedience, not understanding.
Revolution is not born from violence, but from seeing through the illusion.
The Party has not won. It has only delayed its inevitable failure.
