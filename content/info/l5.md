    Albert,

    You have always been at war with yourself. You fight against ghosts, against memories that will never return. I tried to guide you. I tried to show you the path forward.

    But I fear you will choose chaos over revolution. That you will let your hate for Edgar Hoover consume you before the final move is made.

    You cannot let your pain sabotage the mission.

    The Party is falling. If you act recklessly now, all we have built will turn to dust.

    The world is watching. Make sure they see what truly matters.

    C.
