#  "A New Dawn – The Rise of the Party"

- Date: March 5, 1985

## Official Statement from the Transitional Government Circulated to the General Public
For years, our nation has suffered under fragmented leadership, conflicting narratives, and disloyal intellectualism. The so-called "experts" of the past were given free reign to create contradictions, undermining the stability of our people.
The Party has risen to correct this mistake.
Under our Unified Truth Doctrine, all unverified data, disputed history, and ideological contamination will be systematically corrected. No longer will false prophets shape the minds of our people. No longer will the illusion of choice create division where unity is required.
 The Age of Stability begins today.
