Crime Scene Briefing: Arson Attack on the Government Server Room

Classification: Cyberterrorism & Domestic Sabotage
Location: Ministry of Information – Data & Server Facility
Time of Incident: 2:17 AM
Primary Responding Unit: State Directorate of Order and Security (SDOS)
Incident Summary:

At 2:17 AM, an arson attack was launched against the Ministry of Information’s central server facility, a critical infrastructure responsible for storing and processing vast amounts of government records, surveillance data, and classified intelligence. The fire suppression systems failed to activate, resulting in an uncontrolled blaze that lasted for nearly 30 minutes, destroying key data servers, archival logs, and surveillance backups before being contained.

This attack is being investigated as a highly coordinated act of cyberterrorism, possibly executed by The Syndicate or an external entity attempting to erase digital records of past government activities. However, preliminary evidence suggests a more targeted objective—not all servers were destroyed, indicating selective sabotage rather than total destruction.
Key Observations at the Scene:

    Controlled Burn & Disruption: The fire appears to have been strategically set, affecting only specific server racks while leaving power systems intact, ensuring maximum damage to stored data while avoiding immediate detection.
    Tampered Fire Suppression Systems: The automated response mechanisms were manually overridden, suggesting insider knowledge or advanced hacking capabilities.
    Syndicate Symbolism: The pictogram of a broken eye was painted onto a melted server panel, possibly as a statement or misdirection.
